# MP1 - Standard Basic Logic Gate Cell Library & Adder Implementations

This machine problem introduces the approach to cell-based circuit design. 

## Tasks & Goals 
* Create a miniature cell library implementing several basic CMOS logic gates. 
* Implement a full adder and 8-bit adder by plugging these cells together, hierarchically. 
* Begin to understand and appreciate the impact of individual cell design and multiple cell integration on the quality of the overall layout. 

**Note**: These cells will form a library, which will be reused for subsequent MPs.
