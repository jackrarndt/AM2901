# MP2 - Controller Module Automated Synthesis

In this machine problem, we will use automated tools to synthesize the controller module from our MP2 project into a network of standard cells, place those cells onto a layout, and route the cells together into a complete implementation.

## Manual vs. Automatic Circuit Implementation

## MP3 Files
* *ece425mp3.zip*, *ece425mp3oa.zip*, and *ece425mp3top.zip* contain the associated Cadence Virtuoso design files for MP3.
* *mp3_jrarndt2.pdf* constitutes the MP3 Report submission.
* *MP3-SP22* is the provided MP3 documentation. 




## MP3 Report
The MP3 Report is organized in the following order:
**1. Synthesis (rise/fall constraints = 275 and 325 respectively)**
* Area of the controller for each constraint settings.
* Controller schematic generated by synthesis for each constraint settings.
**2. Place and Route:** 
* Summary Report
**3. Top Level Layout:**
* Top-Level (complete AM2901 with controller and datapath) layout with Metal 3 only. (Include Metal 3 & 4 if metal 4 was used with MP3)
* Use ruler to measure the height and width, and **calculate the total layout area**.
