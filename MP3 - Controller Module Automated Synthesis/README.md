# MP3 - Controller Module Automated Synthesis

In this machine problem, we will use automated tools to synthesize the controller module from our MP2 project into a network of standard cells, place those cells onto a layout, and route the cells together into a complete implementation.

## Manual vs. Automatic Circuit Implementation
| Task | Human Engineer | Design Automation Tools |
| ---- | -------------- | ----------------------- |                   
| Logic Optimization | Full knowledge of Boolean Algebra; Ability to go back and change the overall topology. | Incremental optimization based on initial specification + â€œGuess and check." Final results based on initial approximation. |
| Cell Design | Knows every instance of how every cell will be used, and design for one process. | Our MOSIS-based cell library is generalized for many manufacturers and for ease of use to tools. |
| Integration & Routing | Ability to discover physical realities, learn, and revise. | Designed for speed and generality. Placement is a best guess; routing cannot modify placement. |

Highlighted in the table above are key differences between manual and automatic circuit implementations. 

The datapath we created in MP2 optimizes every transistor for optimum efficiency within the well-defined and detailed constraints of the datapath topology and the TSMC process design rules. As we translated the logic specifications to schematics, we applied our full knowledge of logic optimization to improve our overall design. However, our automated tools cannot adapt to the specific task of designing an AM2901, as they are designed to solve the most general problem of circuit design. 

A purely automated approach cannot approach human thoroughness, critical thought, and ingenuity, but it is much less work.

## MP3 Report
The MP3 Report is organized in the following order:

1. **Synthesis (rise/fall constraints = 275 and 325 respectively)**
    * Area of the controller for each constraint settings.
    * Controller schematic generated by synthesis for each constraint settings.
2. **Place and Route:** 
    * Summary Report
3. **Top Level Layout:**
    * Top-Level (complete AM2901 with controller and datapath) layout with Metal 3 only. (Include Metal 3 & 4 if metal 4 was used with MP3)
    * Use ruler to measure the height and width, and **calculate the total layout area**.
